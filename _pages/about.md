I am a researcher and engineer specilizing in non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM) aiming to meeting the demand for sustainable and resilient infrastructures. Currently, I am doing my PhD in [Section of Concrete Structures](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures/sections-labs/concrete-structures), [Department of Engineering Structures](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/).
