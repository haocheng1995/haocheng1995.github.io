I am a researcher and engineer specializing in non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), with a focus on advancing sustainable and resilient infrastructure. I am currently pursuing a PhD in [Section of Concrete Structures](https://www.tudelft.nl/citg/over-faculteit/afdelingen/engineering-structures/sections-labs/concrete-structures), [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/). 

Professional Experience
======
**To be updated**


Research Interests
======
My research interests span a variety of multidisciplinary topics in civil engineering and solid mechanics, including:
1.  Non-linear elastodynamics in compressible solids
1.  Body wave scattering in heterogeneous media
1.  Material characterization using ballistic and diffuse waves
1.  Application of wave interferometry in elastic wave-based structural health monitoring
1.  Long-term monitoring of infrastructures
1.  Application of machine learning in civil engineering
