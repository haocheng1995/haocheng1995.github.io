Monitoring of gradual increase in elastic modulus of concrete over time is crucial for designing structures exposed to early age loading and predicting long-term deformations, such as creep. Two primary methods are used to assess elastic modulus: the static method, involving compression tests, and the dynamic method, utilizing approaches like EMM-ARM (E-modulus Measurement through Ambient Response Method), impact-echo, and ultrasonic approach. The static method, although destructive, yields the static or secant modulus, directly applicable for structural design. However, it cannot be utilized to track changes in elastic modulus within the existing structure caused by factors such as hydration, freeze-thaw, or chemical attack. In contrast, the non-destructive dynamic method can monitor these changes in the existing structure. Yet, the elastic modulus obtained through this method, known as the dynamic elastic modulus, represents the initial tangent modulus and is generally higher than the static modulus. To estimate the static elastic modulus through the non-destructive ultrasonic approach, we propose a new signal processing technique using direct wave interferometry (DWI) in this study. To validate the elastic modulus estimated through this technique, embeddable ultrasonic sensors are installed in the specimen within the temperature stress testing machine (TSTM). The experimental results show that the elastic modulus derived from the newly proposed DWI-based ultrasonic approach consistently provides more accurate estimates of the static elastic modulus compared to the UPV-based dynamic elastic modulus. The relative errors between the DWI-based and compression test-based elastic moduli on 7-day is 2.6â€¯%. This approach also enables the tracking of static elastic modulus changes due to freeze-thaw cycles or chemical attacks.
